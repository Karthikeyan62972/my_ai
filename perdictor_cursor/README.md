# Stock Price Predictor

A robust machine learning system for predicting stock prices using historical tick data from SQLite database.

## Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: Uses ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear models
- **Technical Indicators**: Comprehensive feature engineering with moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error recovery
- **Database Integration**: Direct SQLite database connectivity
- **Real-time Predictions**: Predicts prices for next 15 minutes (configurable)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides prediction confidence based on model agreement

## Requirements

### Core Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

### Optional Dependencies (for enhanced performance)
```bash
pip install xgboost lightgbm ta matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 run_prediction.py NSE:RELIANCE-EQ 15
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
python3 stock_predictor.py NSE:RELIANCE-EQ --minutes 15 --retrain
```

### Available Symbols
The system works with any symbol in your database. Top symbols by volume:
- NSE:NIFTY50-INDEX
- NSE:TATASTEEL-EQ
- NSE:INFY-EQ
- NSE:HDFCBANK-EQ
- NSE:ICICIBANK-EQ
- NSE:RELIANCE-EQ
- NSE:TATAMOTORS-EQ
- NSE:BAJFINANCE-EQ
- NSE:M&M-EQ
- NSE:TCS-EQ

## Database Schema

The system expects a SQLite database with a `ticks` table containing:
- `symbol`: Stock symbol
- `ts`: Timestamp
- `ltp`: Last traded price
- `bid`, `ask`: Bid/ask prices
- `vol_traded_today`: Volume traded
- And other market data fields

## Model Performance

The system uses ensemble learning with the following model weights:
- XGBoost: 30%
- LightGBM: 30% (if available)
- Random Forest: 25%
- Gradient Boosting: 15%
- Linear models: Excluded from ensemble (used for comparison)

## Configuration

### Database Path
Default: `/home/karthik/market.db`
Modify in `StockPredictor` class initialization.

### Model Directory
Default: `models/`
Trained models are saved here for reuse.

### Prediction Timeframe
Default: 15 minutes
Can be configured via command line argument.

## Logging

The system creates detailed logs in `stock_predictor.log` including:
- Training progress
- Model performance metrics
- Error messages
- Prediction results

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Database connection issues
- Insufficient data
- Model training failures
- Prediction errors
- Missing dependencies

## Performance Tips

1. **Install XGBoost and LightGBM** for better accuracy
2. **Use sufficient data** (minimum 1000 records recommended)
3. **Regular retraining** for better predictions
4. **Monitor confidence scores** - low confidence indicates unreliable predictions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'xgboost'"**
   ```bash
   pip install xgboost
   ```

2. **"Insufficient data for training"**
   - Ensure your database has enough historical data
   - Check symbol name is correct

3. **"Database connection error"**
   - Verify database path is correct
   - Check database permissions

4. **Low prediction confidence**
   - Retrain models with more recent data
   - Check for data quality issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Features

The system includes multiple safety features to prevent unrealistic predictions:

- **Realistic Bounds**: Maximum 2% price change for 15-minute predictions
- **Symbol-Specific Models**: Each stock has its own trained model for accuracy
- **Automatic Correction**: Extreme predictions are automatically bounded
- **Confidence Scoring**: Low confidence warnings when predictions are unreliable
